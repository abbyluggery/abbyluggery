### Technical Focus

```
Salesforce Platform     ███████████████████░   95%
Security Architecture   ████████████████████   100%
API Integration         ██████████████████░░   90%
AI/LLM Integration      █████████████████░░░   85%
Mobile Development      ███████████████░░░░░   75%
```

**Core Skills:**
- **Salesforce:** Apex, SOQL, LWC, Flow Builder, REST APIs, Visualforce
- **Security:** Threat modeling, encryption (AES-256-GCM), sandboxed execution, audit logging
- **AI Integration:** Claude API, prompt engineering, hallucination prevention, Ollama (local LLM)
- **Mobile:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Room Database, Android Security APIs

### Background

10+ years in financial services including:
- **AML Compliance** at Citigroup (NICE Actimize, FinCEN reporting)
- **Data Governance** at Macquarie Capital (99% data integrity, global Salesforce CRM)
- **Regulatory Operations** at Freedom Mortgage (TILA, RESPA, TRID compliance)

I understand what enterprise systems need because I've lived the consequences of systems that don't work.

---

### Development Approach

I architect systems using modern AI-assisted development workflows. I design the architecture, make all technical decisions, and can explain every component and why it exists.

**What this means:**
- I understand the "why" behind every design decision
- I can defend architectural choices in technical discussions
- I iterate rapidly while maintaining code quality
- I focus on security implications from day one

---

### Security Philosophy

I build security systems because I understand threat modeling from lived experience. My projects demonstrate:

- **Layered Defense:** Multiple protection mechanisms, not single points of failure
- **Privacy by Design:** Encryption at rest and in transit, minimal data collection
- **Threat-Aware Architecture:** Systems designed for adversarial conditions
- **Graceful Degradation:** Offline capabilities, fallback mechanisms

---

### Current Focus

- Completing Salesforce Administrator Certification
- Expanding AI integration patterns (Agentforce, prompt engineering)
- Open to remote Salesforce Developer / Technical Solutions roles
